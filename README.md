Capstone for Per Scholas Full-Stack Java Developer Course Powered By TEKsystems

Hello, my name is Dylan Dinh. This is a simple project that I made for the capstone project required for a course by Per Scholas to show what I've learned from the course. The purpose of this website is to add in your sheet music onto the website for others to see. There is a login and registration feature, and when you make an account, you are able to post your music sheets, edit them, and delete them. Also, an account is not needed to view the music sheets posted by people. This was my first time creating a huge project like this by myself while using Spring Boot, Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Thymeleaf, so the project may have bugs, may be missing a lot features, and may be a bit unorganized.
